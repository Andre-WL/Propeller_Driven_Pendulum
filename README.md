# Propeller_Driven_Pendulum
VUW EEEN315 2022 Project

This project began with the mathematical analysis of a propeller driven rigid pendulum.
A transfer function was derived relating the voltage on the propellor motor, to the displacement
angle of the pendulum arm. The transfer function was then analysed using root locus and Bode
plot techniques to determine the type of compensator that would result in the best step response.
This was tested via Simulink, set up to take a set point angle as an input, and finally applied to
a physical pendulum. The compensator I design resulted in a 2 second settling time, with minimal
overshoot to an applied step input.

This repository contains (or will contain) the reports written for this project, python and MATLAB code used,
image files of figures used in the second report, and simulink files.
